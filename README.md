Notebooks -
<b>EDA.ipynb</b> - Data Exploration; data cleaning; raw functions to convert text into numericals

Quick notes on EDA -

* One line from the XLSX file is omitted; it contains 412 columns instead of 19; the product is Roller Brush.

* All the names of colours of paints, stains etc need to go in, for the future pipeline to function properly.

* All the CAS numbers are same as chemicals, except for one row (16681). Ignoring that because there is one chemical in it.
